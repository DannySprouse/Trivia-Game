US Capitals Trivia Game

This Trivia Game is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery.  It consists of a home page that links to four separate game play pages, representing various regions of the United States.  The game has a countdown timer, and provides a summary score at the end.
